What is this?

Uncraftable Exotic Weapons! This mod adds uncraftable weapons to the game, which must either be purchased from merchants, or acquired as quest rewards.


Weapons

A34_Harvester
- This gun can harvest an enemy's undamaged organs. Can potentially harvest multiple organs, though harvesting a heart or liver results in their instant death.

NU43_Humiliator
- Makes your opponents drop everything, including their weapons and armor. Great for when you're up against a powerful enemy, or really really want their clothes.

XM8_Prototype
- Similar to assault rifle, has higher damage and accuracy but slower rate of fire.


Questions

Q: Do these guns only work on living pawns?

A: Yes, these guns only work on living pawns.

Q: Are these guns balanced with vanilla?

A: Yes, these guns are balanced with vanilla. They are intentionally designed as niche weapons that will not compete with conventional weapons when it comes to killing. For instance, the A34_Harvester has a chance to not harvest organs at all. When it does harvest organs, it harvests them randomly, meaning that it won't kill a pawn if it chooses to harvest a lung or kidney instead of a heart or liver. If you want to kill an enemy, you're probably still better off using an assault rifle. However, the A34_Harvester could potentially net you a free organ, without giving your colonists the "harvested organ" debuff - essentially free money.

Q: Why would I want to use the NU43_Humiliator?

A: It strips enemies of their gear without killing them, which means you won't get the nasty "tainted" modifier to their clothing. It also works on mechanoids..
